	Foxes are omnivorous mammals that are light on their feet. 
	They are often mistaken for other members of the Canidae family, 
	which include jackals, wolves and dogs. They stand out from their 
	relatives because of their long, thin legs, lithe frame, pointed nose and bushy tail. <br>

	These animals are very social and live flexible lives. 
	They are found all over the world — in North America, 
	Europe, Asia and North Africa — and call a wide range 
	of terrains their home. They also eat a greatly varied diet. <br><br>
